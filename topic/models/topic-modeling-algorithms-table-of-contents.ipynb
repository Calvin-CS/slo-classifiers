    "HLDA is a recursive extension of the LDA algorithm that produces a hierarchy of topics and sub-topics.  LDA is implemented on the original corpus of documents resulting in the usual document-topic and word-topic assignments.  Then, \"synthetic\" documents are created from the word-topic assignments for each document-topic assignment and are grouped into \"synthetic\" corpora by topic.  LDA is implemented recursively on the \"synthetic\" corpora until \"synthetic\" documents and corpora are no longer able to be generated.  For each level of the recursion, a hierarchy of topic distributions are generated, resulting in a tree-like structure. \n",

The model infers the topic of each document using the topics its biterms are associated with.  Hypothetically, topic extraction is easier with this model as inferring the topic of a biterm is easier with the added context provided using word co-occurrences over individual words with no context."
