    "Imagine a modified Pólya urn scheme as follows. We start with an urn with $\\alpha$  black balls. When drawing a ball from the urn, if we draw a black ball, put the ball back along with a new ball of a new non-black color randomly generated from a uniform distribution over an infinite set of available colours, and consider the newly generated color to be the \"value\" of the draw. Otherwise, put the ball back along with another ball of the same color, as for the standard Pólya urn scheme. The colors of an infinite sequence of draws from this modified Pólya urn scheme follow a Chinese restaurant process. If, instead of generating a new color, we draw a random value from a given base distribution and use that value to label the ball, the labels of an infinite sequence of draws follow a Dirichlet process.\n",

In the CRF, there exists a global menu of dishes shared among all restaurants, and a new table is assigned one of the existing dishes $k$ with probability proportional to $m_{k}$, the number of tables currently serving dish $k$ over all restaurants $j = 1, ..., J$.
