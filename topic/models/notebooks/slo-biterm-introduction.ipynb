    "The Biterm Topic Model (BTM) is a word co-occurrence based topic model that learns topics by modeling word-word co-occurrences patterns (e.g., biterms)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A biterm consists of two words co-occurring in the same context, for example, in the same short text window.\n",
    "* BTM models the biterm occurrences in a corpus (unlike LDA models which model the word occurrences in a document).\n",
    "* It's a generative model. In the generation procedure, a biterm is generated by drawing two words independently from a same topic $z$. In other words, the distribution of a biterm $b=(wi,wj)$ is defined as: $P(b) = \\sum_{k}{P(wi|z)*P(wj|z)*P(z)}$ where $k$ is the number of topics you want to extract.\n",
