# Topic Classifier

The topic classifier is a legacy system.

Early work on SLO developed a "value-tree" for topics, including
governance, social, economic and environmental, but the distinctions
were too challenging to tag and classify accurately so the task was
scaled back to use the Triple-Bottom Line (TBL), which is a more
forgiving task.
