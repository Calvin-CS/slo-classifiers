# Topic Classifier

The topic classifier is a legacy system.

Early work on SLO developed a "value-tree" for topics, including governance, 
social, economic and environmental, but the distinctions were too challenging 
to tag and classify accurately so the task was scaled back to use the 
Triple-Bottom Line (TBL), which is a more forgiving task.

Finished preliminary data analysis on SLO Twitter dataset. Current work consists 
of topic extraction using Latent-Dirichlet Allocation. Possible additions 
include bi-term models, hierarchical models, and topic-author models for topic 
extraction.
